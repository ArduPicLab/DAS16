A 16 channels 12 bits acquisition system
Today many microcontrollers have one or two 10-bit or more built in AD converters with a multi-channel multiplexer, but the quality of conversion is rather poor because of the considerable background noise always present together with a low linearity. So, I think it will be useful the proposed system, since the components are still readily available and the results obtained are at a professional level.
However I think that even with a different ADC hardware, the software used is still valid, as a result of years of experience. The system design is a front end controlled remotely via a serial link that can be the standard RS232 / RS422, or wireless.
